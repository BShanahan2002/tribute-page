        <h2>intro</h2>
        <p>
             Watford Football Club is an English professional football club based in Watford, Hertfordshire.
             They play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They will compete in the EFL 
             Championship in the 2022–23 season following their relegation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The club’s original foundation is 1881, aligned with that of its antecedent, Watford Rovers,
            and was established as Watford Football Club in 1898. After finishing the 1914–15 season as
            Southern League champions under the management of Harry Kent, Watford joined the Football 
            League in 1920. The team played at several grounds in their early history, including what 
            is now West Herts Sports Club,[3] before moving to Vicarage Road in 1922. They have a 
            long-standing rivalry with nearby club Luton Town.

        <h2>Club Identity</h2>
        <p>
            Watford's kit has changed considerably over the course of the club's history. The club's kit
            featured various combinations of red, green and yellow stripes, before a new colour scheme of 
            black and white was adopted for the 1909–10 season. These colours were retained until the 1920s, 
            when the club introduced an all-blue shirt. After a change of colours to gold shirts and black 
            shorts for 1959–60, the team's nickname was changed to The Hornets, after a popular vote via 
            the supporters club. These colours remained until 1976, when Watford's kits started featuring 
            red, and the gold was changed to yellow. That colour scheme has continued into the 21st century.
        </p>
        <p>
            Watford's initial nickname was The Brewers, in reference to the Benskins Brewery, which owned the 
            freehold of Vicarage Road. This nickname did not prove particularly popular, and upon the adoption 
            of a blue-and-white colour scheme in the 1920s, the club became predominantly known as The Blues. 
            When Watford changed kit colours in 1959, supporters chose The Hornets as the team's new nickname, 
            and the club later introduced a crest depicting a hornet. In 1974 the design was changed to depict 
            Harry the Hornet, the club's mascot. The club's nickname remains, but in 1978 the hornet 
            crest was replaced by a depiction of a hart – a male red fallow deer– on a yellow and black background. 
            A hart represents the town's location in the county of Hertfordshire. Until Barnet and, later, 
            Stevenage joined the Football League, Watford were Hertfordshire's only league club. Other nicknames
             have since been adopted, including Yellow Army and The 'Orns.
